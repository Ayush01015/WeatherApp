# WeatherApp


This is a weather app implemented in React.js that allows users to get weather information for different locations. The app uses the RapidAPI service to fetch weather data and provides a user-friendly and responsive interface with a shimmer UI effect to improve the user experience.

## Features

- **Change Location**: Users can enter the name of any location they want to get the weather information for. The app will fetch and display the weather data for the specified location.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent and optimal user experience.

- **Shimmer UI**: A shimmer effect is implemented to show a loading placeholder while fetching weather data. This adds a nice touch to the user interface and indicates that data is being loaded.
